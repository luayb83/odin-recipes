    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This vegan Jamaican curry dish is full of earthy goodness. The sautéed
        tofu combined with the boldness from the curry and creaminess from the
        coconut makes this dish a must try! Serve over rice.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons grapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package tofu, cut into bite-sized cubes</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons Jamaican yellow curry powder, divided</li>
        <li>1 small zucchini, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced cremini mushrooms or baby bellas</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat grapeseed oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pat excess water from tofu with a paper
                towel, and fry tofu in the hot skillet until browned around the edges, about 4 minutes per side. Remove
                from skillet and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add onions, bell peppers, and 1 tablespoon curry powder to the skillet and sauté for 2 minutes. Add
                zucchini and mushrooms to the skillet; sauté for 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return tofu to the skillet, add 1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to taste, and mix well. Pour in
                coconut milk, stir well. Reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt
                and pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
